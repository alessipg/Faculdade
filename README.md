# üìö Codes Developed During My Computer Science Degree

> ‚ùó **Important:** If you are a student (especially from UTFPR-PG), please note that the purpose of this repository is to document my entire learning journey ‚Äî both to track my progress and to contribute to the GitHub community.  
> I strongly recommend avoiding direct copies of the code. Instead, focus on understanding the reasoning and logic behind each line. Remember: it is not merely about completing an academic assignment, but about building your professional skills and deepening your knowledge.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by academic semesters.  
Each semester directory (e.g., `2023_1`) contains subdirectories named after the course titles (e.g., `Data Structures`, `Computer Graphics`).  
Within each course folder, you will find further subdivisions such as `Codes`, `Projects`, or `Exercises`, depending on the nature of the material developed during the course.

Since each course follows a different schedule, there is no single organizational pattern that applies uniformly to all of them.

## ‚úèÔ∏è Note

I wrote these codes while studying specific subjects at that time.  
It is likely that some files contain errors or bad practices that I was not aware of in the past.
